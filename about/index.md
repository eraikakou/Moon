<center><a href="https://eraikakou.github.io/"><b>Data Explosion</b></a> is a blog including posts and projects regarding big data systems, machine learning models and some maths.</center>

My goal is to share projects related to Data Science field fully documented followed by references on the corresponding code. My content will be focused on Text Mining area, Machine Learning and Deep Learing Models, as well as on some theory explanations and maths. 

I'm always open to ideas of how to improve my projects, or the website in general, so please get in touch with suggestions :)
